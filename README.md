# Game-Programming-Course-Week-10

In the tenth week of the Game Programming course, I focused on enhancing the game's visuals and audio to create a more immersive player experience. This project includes the addition of post-processing effects, background music, and various sound effects for in-game actions such as firing lasers, explosions, and collecting bonuses.

This project demonstrates the following fundamental skills:

- Setting up and configuring Unity's Post Processing package.
- Enhancing visuals with bloom and color grading effects.
- Adding background music for continuous gameplay ambiance.
- Integrating sound effects for laser firing, enemy explosions, and bonus collection.

This project improved my understanding of Unity's audio tools and post-processing capabilities while demonstrating how audio-visual elements can enhance a gameâ€™s overall polish and engagement.
